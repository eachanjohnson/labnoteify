## Labnoteify

# Introduction
Is your lab notebook made up of random files on your computer?

*Labnoteify* is a framework for compiling these into something more meaningful. After running `python labnoteify.py setup`, run `python labnoteify.py noteify` to convert everything you want into a browsable HTML notebook.

# Features
- Runs on Python 2.7, so portable for Unix, Mac OSX, Windows, Linux
- Organises most common files into a date-ordered HTML lab notebook:
-- R and Python code
-- XLSX spreadsheets (except embedded charts)
-- DOCX documents
-- PDFs
-- PNGs and JPEGs

# Wishlist
- PDF output for printing
- Compatibility with DOC and XLS legacy formats

# Issues
- PDFs don't embed properly
- Setup process doesn't make much sense
